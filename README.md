# FAQ

**1. How many rounds are there?**

The number of Rounds depends on the Legend's level, eg. Legend #1 = 20 Rounds, Legend #2 = 19 Rounds, Legend #3 = 18 Rounds, etc.

**2. Can a Legend score during a Bonus Streak?**

No. The Legend's scoring freezes during a Players streak.

**3. What happens if a Player misses with all 3 darts in a Round?**

The match continues to the next Round where the Legend automatically progresses to their next number and the Player re-attempts their current number.

**4. Can a Player hit more than one number per Round?**

Yes. As soon as a Player hits the correct number, they move directly onto the next number with their next dart.

**5. Is commentating during a match in the style of a TV commentator a sign of madness?**

No! Chase The Legend can be an exciting game, so have fun with it :)
