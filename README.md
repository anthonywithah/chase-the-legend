# Legend's Ranking

Two websites were used to fairly decide the rank of each Legend;

- **Upcoming Legends**: https://www.pdc.tv/order-of-merit/pdc-order-merit
- **All Time Legends**: https://news.williamhill.com/darts/ten-greatest-darts-players-of-all-time

The resources for this game will be updated periodically when ranks change.

# History

I first created this game when I was a kid sometime in the early 1990's. In those days I wrote the Legend's down on scraps of paper, with the great John Lowe being the top guy. Fast forward a few decades later, a new dartboard and many hours of Photoshop'in - I recreated this game here. Firstly to learn to throw again after a lengthy break and secondly to share this game with the community for others to enjoy.

# FAQ

**1. How many Rounds are there?**

The number of Rounds depends on the Legend's level, eg. Legend #1 = 20 Rounds, Legend #2 = 19 Rounds, Legend #3 = 18 Rounds, etc.

**2. Can a Legend score during a Bonus Streak?**

No. The Legend's scoring freezes during a Players streak.

**3. What happens if a Player misses with all 3 darts in a Round?**

The match continues to the next Round where the Legend automatically progresses to their next number and the Player re-attempts their current number.

**4. Can a Player hit more than one number per Round?**

Yes. As soon as a Player hits the correct number, they move directly onto the next number with their next dart.

**5. Is commentating during a match in the style of a TV commentator a sign of madness?**

No! Chase The Legend can be an exciting game, so have fun with it :)
